# Front End
This is designed for my love and passion for CSS.  I've recreated websites from scratch that I believe are doing innovative, responsive, and intuitive front end work.  I've created elements of their websites including landing pages, dashboards, and certain features.  It's out of a joy and passion for front end, a desire to strengthen my skills and also to appreciate and learn from the work that went into creating these websites.
